CAPSTONE IDEAS - Ayse Sokmen

1. Fire App
https://docs.ambeedata.com/#fire-intro
An application that will display the map of ongoing wildfires near the user’s location. The user will enter their address and the app will provide them a local map regarding the user’s input with fires taking place near them.
I want to make this app because the wildfires due to deforestation and climate change taking place in many different locations around the world have impacted the ecosystem, animals and humans deeply. 
It allows users to reach the location of the fires around them directly without being exposed to censorship, so they can be prepared for the disaster, take action on time and help others.

2. Cooking App

Don’t suit yourself to the recipes, let the recipes suit you with what you have!
A cooking application that will breakdown a list of recipes with the ingredients user have at home. This app will take the ingredients as user input and display a list of recipes including those ingredients. If you like cooking but you feel frustrated by having to think of what to cook every day, this app will be a great source to inspire you with different recipes in a practical and an unwaistful way.

3. Pet Adoption App

It’s a great app for finding new homes to rescued animals. Users can search animals by their location, species and status. After finding the perfect match they’ll be linked with organizations that will help them with the adoption process and protocols.
There are too many animals waiting to be adopted and deserve good care and love from humans, by making this app i want to help them find a permanent home and a family.
